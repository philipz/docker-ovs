docker-ovs
==========

docker-ovs creates userspace [Open vSwitch](http://openvswitch.org) containers.
Running Open vSwitch in userspace mode is experimental and performance is not guaranteed.
This is provided for testing purposes, specifically for testing against multiple versions of openvswitch with CI tools.

## Installation

The containers live on the Docker Index so they can be easily used as follows:

    docker pull davetucker/docker-ovs

Or:

    docker pull davetucker/docker-ovs:2.1.2

Or even:

    docker run -t -i davetucker/docker-ovs:2.1.2 /bin/sh

## Running the container

To run the container listening on port 6640 (OVSDB) and 9001 (Supervisor XML-RPC API) and with supervisor managing the Open vSwitch processes:

    sudo docker run -p 6640:6640 -p 9001:9001 --privileged=true -d -i -t davetucker/docker-ovs:2.1.2 /usr/bin/supervisord

To run the container listening on port 6640 (OVSDB) and 9001 (Supervisor XML-RPC API) with a shell - you must manually start the process:

    sudo docker run -p 6640:6640 -p 9001:9001 --privileged=true -i -t davetucker/docker-ovs:2.1.2 /bin/sh

> Note: You need the "tun" kernel module loaded to run this container, ex: sudo modprobe tun

> Note: Change the tag for a different OVS version e.g davetucker/docker-ovs:2.0.0

> Note: Docker 0.10.0 upwards does not require the `--privileged=true` flag as 0.10.0 allows non-privileged containers to create device nodes. See the [Docker Changelog](https://github.com/dotcloud/docker/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for more information.

### Supported Releases

The follwing releases are supported:

- 1.4.6
- 1.5.0
- 1.6.1
- 1.7.0
- 1.7.1
- 1.7.3
- 1.9.0
- 1.9.3

- 1.10.2
- 1.11.0
- 2.0.0
- 2.0.1

- 2.1.1
- 2.1.2

### Creating bridges

To create bridges, please set the datapath type to `netdev` as advised in the Open vSwitch's [INSTALL.userspace](http://git.openvswitch.org/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=openvswitch;a=blob;f=INSTALL.userspace;h=f54b93e2e54c2efdc88054519038d98390e4183c;hb=HEAD)

    ovs-vsctl add-br br0
    ovs-vsctl set bridge br0 datapath_type=netdev
    ovs-vsctl add-port br0 eth0
    ovs-vsctl add-port br0 eth1
    ovs-vsctl add-port br0 eth2

### Hardware VTEP Support

Hardware VTEP support is enabled on OVS verisons greater than 2.1.0

To use this, make the necessary configuration changes over OVSDB or via the `ctl` commands in the container:

- Create a bridge called `br-vtep`
- Add a `eth0` to `br-vtep`
- Add the bridge and port as a Physical_Switch
- Set the `tunnel_ips`

Example using `ovs-vsctl` and `vtep-ctl`:

    ovs-vsctl add-br br-vtep
    ovs-vsctl add-port br-vtep eth0
    vtep-ctl add-ps br-vtep
    vtep-ctl add-port br-vtep eth0
    vtep-ctl set Physical_Switch br-vtep tunnel_ips=192.168.0.3

To start the VTEP Simulator you can use the Supervisor XML-RPC API

    export DOCKER_IP="<ip address>"
    ./scripts/start-vtep.py

## Test Environment

To bring up the test environment

    vagrant up

## Building Containers

The build system for the containers now uses [BuildRoot](http://buildroot.uclibc.org/) in addition to [Packer](http://packer.io)
To build the containers, pull up the Vagrantbox as shown above.

    cd /tmp/buildroot
    echo 'source "package/openvswitch/Config.in"' >> Config.in
    make menuconfig

From the menu select:

    openvswitch
    Target Packages > Utilities > Supervisor

Then exit.

    cd /vagrant
    ./build-containers.sh

This could take up to 5 hours the first time depending on how powerful your VM is!
Once this has finished you'll see a lot of `ovsbase-${version}` docker containers.
These are used by Packer to assemble the final containers.

If you want to do a "clean" build after you've added/removed some packages or libraries.

    ./build-containers -r

If you've made changes and are *sure* that you only need to run `make` for each container.

    ./build-containers -r

## Updating containers

Assuming you only want to make configuration changes.

- Changes to the install/configure scripts
- Changes to docker-ovs.json

You can run:

    ./reconfigure-containers.sh

This will re-run Packer and build your newly configured containers.
